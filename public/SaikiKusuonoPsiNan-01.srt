1
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,724
<i>Psychic powers</i>

2
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,393
<i>make the impossible possible.</i>

3
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,145
What a cutie!

4
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,688
I'm a huge dog lover.

5
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,648
<i>But I love chicks even more.</i>

6
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:48,567
Wait, Pochimi!

7
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:51,153
Watch out!

8
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,827
So, how about we go get something to eat?

9
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,495
What are you talking about?

10
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,497
<i>My name is Kusuo Saiki.</i>

11
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,124
<i>I'm a psychic.</i>

12
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,418
<i>Sixteen years ago,</i>

13
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,004
<i>an ordinary couple had a baby boy</i>

14
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,423
<i>who was anything but ordinary.</i>

15
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,009
Look how cute he is!
He's as cute as his mommy!

16
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,011
So cute! He's as cute as his daddy!

17
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:20,223
-Such a cutie pie.
-<i>So, I'm only in second place?</i>

18
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,934
<i>I started talking when I was
only 14 days old</i>

19
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,102
<i>without using my voice.</i>

20
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,020
<i>And then...</i>

21
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,981
Look who's walking! Look who's walking!

22
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,442
<i>When I was a month old, I started to walk</i>

23
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,152
-<i>in the air.</i>
-Amazing!

24
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,195
ONE YEAR OLD

25
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,613
<i>And when I was one...</i>

26
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,324
Looks like we're out of rice wine.

27
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,242
Ku?

28
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,662
<i>I successfully ran my first errand.</i>

29
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,413
Ku...

30
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,583
<i>That's when my mom
finally started to worry.</i>

31
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,001
<i>You would think</i>

32
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,754
<i>that at this point, my parents
would take me to get checked out.</i>

33
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,881
<i>But they're pretty weird too.</i>

34
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,050
I bet he stole them.

35
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,135
I'll take him to the supermarket tomorrow.

36
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,387
<i>They're pretty lazy, too.</i>

37
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,889
Our little psychic paid after all!

38
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:01,807
He takes after you.

39
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,935
<i>They're a pretty happy-go-lucky couple,
and they act like silly little lovebirds.</i>

40
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,478
<i>So they accepted me as I was</i>

41
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,106
-<i>without any fuss.</i>
-He's so artistic!

42
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,273
<i>The days went by.</i>

43
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,858
OZAWA

44
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,027
<i>And that little boy</i>

45
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,405
<i>became a high school student.</i>

46
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,783
<i>As you saw earlier,
I still have my psychic powers.</i>

47
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,285
<i>I can bend spoons without touching them,</i>

48
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,538
<i>and I can hit it big whenever I want to.</i>

49
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:27,249
<i>I'm living the dream.</i>

50
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,586
<i>I bet that's what you're thinking, right?</i>

51
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,296
<i>So, what if I can bend spoons?</i>

52
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,048
<i>That just makes it hard to eat my curry.</i>

53
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,008
<i>And winning free snacks</i>

54
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,385
<i>just gives me stomachaches.</i>

55
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,431
<i>If you think I'm the happiest guy alive
and that I have it all,</i>

56
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,557
<i>you're dead wrong.</i>

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,518
<i>I'm the unhappiest guy alive
and I have nothing.</i>

58
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,854
<i>Telepathy, psychokinesis,</i>

59
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,230
<i>X-ray vision, foresight,</i>

60
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,023
<i>teleportation, clairvoyance,
and et cetera...</i>

61
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,775
<i>I can do all those things.</i>

62
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:57,154
<i>But for each thing I can do,
there's something I can't do.</i>

63
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,489
<i>A dog that's fed by its owners</i>

64
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,992
<i>never learns to hunt for food on its own.</i>

65
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,703
<i>Spoiled children who always
get what they want</i>

66
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,413
<i>never learn how to be independent.</i>

67
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,416
<i>So trust me, I've missed out on so much!</i>

68
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,877
<i>I don't know what it's like
to feel a sense of accomplishment.</i>

69
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,962
<i>I've never been surprised
by a surprise party.</i>

70
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,672
<i>I can't experience any of these things.</i>

71
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:19,468
<i> It's true that I never get angry or sad,
but I never feel happy, either.</i>

72
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,303
<i>That's my life.</i>

73
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,640
<i>Still, I wouldn't say
I'm disappointed or anything.</i>

74
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,976
<i>A life without ups and downs
isn't all that bad.</i>

75
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,519
<i>Kusuo is late.</i>

76
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,023
Oh, you're back!

77
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,900
What took you so long?

78
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,235
<i>Why is Dad hanging out
in front of the house?</i>

79
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,862
I was wondering

80
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,280
if you could open the door for me.

81
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,616
-I couldn't get in.
-<i>Really? Again?</i>

82
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:51,750
That's my little psychic!
Such amazing lock picking skills!

83
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,751
<i>I'm not a burglar.</i>

84
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,668
Kusuo,

85
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,463
I think you can do something amazing
with your powers.

86
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,298
<i>Keep those thoughts to yourself.</i>

87
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,050
Ku, is that you?

88
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,885
We'll talk more about this later, Kusuo!

89
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,388
<i>Actually, there is one thing
that disturbs my rather calm life.</i>

90
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,557
Why did you change the lock again?

91
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,309
<i>That would be my parents' relationship.</i>

92
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,687
Welcome home, Ku!
We're having pork cutlets for dinner!

93
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,064
Stop ignoring me!

94
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,149
And we are supposed to have steak today!

95
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,527
Oh, is that so? So sorry!
How about I fix you a leather shoe?

96
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,821
-Why would I want a shoe?
-<i>I wonder where it all went wrong.</i>

97
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,032
-Your love makes me high like Tokyo Tower!
-<i>They used to be so lovey-dovey.</i>

98
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,159
-I love you more than anyone in the world.
-Oh, you...

99
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,329
You make me want to push you off
the Tokyo Skytree!

100
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,039
I hate you more than anyone
in the universe!

101
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,541
You little...

102
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,293
<i>Well, I guess you could say
they're still passionate about each other.</i>

103
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,636
Time to dig in! Help yourself!

104
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,264
-Hey! Hey!
-How is it, Ku?

105
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,683
-Honey, there's seconds for you too!
-No thank you!

106
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,893
-I bet it's just the other shoe!
-Here you go!

107
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,228
That's not even from the same pair!

108
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,981
<i>It's been like this for half a year.</i>

109
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,107
Kusuo,

110
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,068
do me a favor and transform this
into a steak, would you?

111
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:03,154
<i>The pathetic man you see here
is my father, Kuniharu Saiki.</i>

112
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,949
<i>He's lazy and irresponsible
and always comes crying to me for help.</i>

113
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,243
<i>I've learned to ignore
basically all of his requests.</i>

114
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,580
<i>I can't spoil him,
or else he'll just get worse.</i>

115
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,623
So, you're taking your mom's side?

116
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,749
That food on your plate

117
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,544
was bought with the money I earned
by licking my boss' boots!

118
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,046
Expensive shoes taste so much better!

119
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,715
<i>Wow, so you actually like
the taste of shoes?</i>

120
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:23,925
Screw it! I'll eat it anyway!

121
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,010
Yuck, this stinks!

122
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,428
What's with this smell? Geez!

123
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,763
<i>It's a shoe, dummy.</i>

124
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:32,684
Ku, your powers aren't meant
to be wasted on something like that.

125
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,519
<i>This is my mother, Kurumi Saiki.</i>

126
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,981
You should use your powers
to help those in need

127
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,942
or to reward people who are nice!

128
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,861
<i>She's one of the main reasons</i>

129
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,487
<i>I haven't used my powers for evil.</i>

130
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,281
<i>She's a gentle, loving mother.</i>

131
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,950
You should also use them
to punish your dad.

132
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,952
<i>I don't think you can tell from today.</i>

133
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,454
KUSUO'S PORK CUTLET

134
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,749
How dare you eat Ku's food,
you son of a bitch!

135
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,376
We're taking this outside!

136
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,502
I'll pass...

137
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,422
<i>I could stop them whenever I want to,</i>

138
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,341
<i>but this is their problem to solve.</i>

139
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,258
<i>What?</i>

140
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:06,760
<i>Coffee jelly.</i>

141
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,970
<i>It's actually not that bad.</i>

142
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,556
<i>It takes the rich, robust scent
and flavor of coffee</i>

143
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,976
<i>and condenses them into a single
sublime package.</i>

144
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,730
<i>If you add a splash of milk, you'll have
a whole new experience on your hands.</i>

145
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,899
<i>Something this decadent should be illegal.</i>

146
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,901
<i>But I'm not complaining.</i>

147
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,281
Wow, is the jelly that good?

148
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,283
Forget about that!
We've got bigger issues!

149
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,327
Look at what your mom has become!

150
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,829
-Stop running, you coward!
-You have to stop her, Kusuo!

151
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,915
She's no longer the mother you once knew!

152
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,833
Do it! Exorcise the demon inside of her!

153
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,877
There's no escape!

154
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,545
I'll crush you like an ant!

155
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,342
What?

156
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,719
What the...

157
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,554
<i>These two are such a handful.</i>

158
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,139
<i>I wish I didn't have to step in</i>

159
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,141
<i>to stop another pointless fight.</i>

160
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,643
So, now you're on your dad's side?

161
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,061
That's it! I hate you too!

162
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,563
<i>Why do I say it's pointless, you ask?
You'll see.</i>

163
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,357
I hate both of you!

164
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,776
<i>Of course I don't hate you.
I love you both so much!</i>

165
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,403
<i>The voices inside their hearts say it all.</i>

166
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,322
<i>No matter how much they try to hide it,</i>

167
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,366
<i>the truth is
that these are all sham fights.</i>

168
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,993
Fine, I hate you too!

169
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,160
I hate you so much!

170
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,370
<i>Just kidding!</i>

171
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,247
<i>I love you to death! </i>

172
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,625
<i>And that's why they're pointless.</i>

173
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,671
<i>The worst thing is that they interrupted
my dessert time.</i>

174
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,590
<i>And that is a sin
this psychic cannot forgive.</i>

175
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,134
<i>-I love you.
-I love you.</i>

176
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,344
Did you just say you love me?

177
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,179
<i>Does she actually love me back?</i>

178
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,889
Wait, wasn't that you?

179
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,517
<i>Oh no! Did I say that out loud?</i>

180
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,728
<i>And what does "love me back" mean?</i>

181
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,480
No, it was you! You just admitted
that you said it out loud.

182
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,565
<i>Wait a second...</i>

183
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,026
<i>Am I hearing things
because I love her so much?</i>

184
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,444
<i>Wait, he loves me "so much"?</i>

185
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,195
<i>Wait, can she hear me?</i>

186
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,155
I guess I did...

187
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,990
-<i>So, he did say it.</i>
-No, I didn't!

188
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:52,907
-What?
-What?

189
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,325
-Kusuo!
-Ku!

190
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,036
<i>Forced telepathy.</i>

191
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,955
<i>I used my powers to link their minds,</i>

192
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,250
<i>which means they can hear
each other's thoughts.</i>

193
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,420
Stop it! I don't want him to know
that I still love him!

194
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,256
I don't want your mother to know
that I still love her!

195
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,924
I love you.

196
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,051
I love you, too.

197
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:11,968
<i>Whatever. The end.</i>

198
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,846
-I'm so sorry, honey!
-Me, too!

199
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,640
<i>I swear, dealing with normal people
is such a pain.</i>

200
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,560
<i>Now I can enjoy my dessert in peace.</i>

201
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,688
This is all because I ate
your coffee jelly!

202
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:24,689
No!

203
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:29,069
I shouldn't have lost my temper
and broke all the windows in the house!

204
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,528
Hold on a second.

205
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,781
Here! Have this as a token
of our renewed love!

206
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,491
Is it good?

207
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,911
You bet! Something this decadent
should be illegal! It's delicious!

208
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,003
PK ACADEMY

209
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,922
<i>This is my high school, PK Academy.</i>

210
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,258
<i>There are 542 students all in all.</i>

211
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:56,387
<i>But not a single one of them
knows about my powers.</i>

212
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,640
<i>If they found out,
all hell would break loose.</i>

213
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,850
<i>Back in kindergarten,</i>

214
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,770
<i>I would always win at rock-paper-scissors.</i>

215
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,856
<i>I could read everyone's thoughts,
after all.</i>

216
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,942
<i>Some of them tried to cheat,</i>

217
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,401
<i>but I just forced a tie.</i>

218
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:14,280
<i>Kindergarten is a lawless jungle
where rock-paper-scissors decides all.</i>

219
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,158
Kusuo, how about we play
rock-paper-scissors?

220
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,494
If I win, you should share it
with everyone, okay?

221
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,204
<i>I showed my teachers no mercy.</i>

222
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,664
-We'll play three times.
-<i>I destroyed everyone in my path.</i>

223
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:23,748
-Best out of ten?
-<i>Won</i>.

224
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,084
-Best out of 100. I just need to win once.
-<i>Won</i>.

225
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,544
I'll show you rock!

226
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,461
<i>I won them all.</i>

227
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,546
296 WINS, 0 DEFEAT, 58 DRAWS

228
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,090
<i>My teacher stopped showing up
the next day.</i>

229
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,008
<i>And this was just the beginning.</i>

230
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,928
<i>It took a while for things to settle down.</i>

231
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,890
<i>So I decided not to use my powers
in public ever again.</i>

232
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,350
<i>If I have to use them,</i>

233
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,769
<i>I always make sure no one's around.</i>

234
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,189
<i>I use telepathy to make sure
no one is in the vicinity.</i>

235
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,358
<i>I can detect people in a 200-meter radius.</i>

236
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,484
<i>I don't miss a soul.</i>

237
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,443
Guess who?

238
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:53,361
<i>Well, almost.</i>

239
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,947
<i>There's one guy I can't detect.</i>

240
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,532
How's it going, pal?

241
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,201
<i>Riki Nendo. No one likes him,</i>

242
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,536
<i>but he likes me for some reason.</i>

243
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,788
<i>But that's not the real issue.</i>

244
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,959
<i>The problem is that I can't read
this guy's thoughts at all.</i>

245
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,837
<i>And everyone has thoughts.</i>

246
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,380
<i>-Like this guy...
-I hate the dentist...</i>

247
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,549
<i>-Or this guy...
-Nose hair!</i>

248
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:18,595
<i>I can even read animals' minds.
But this guy is the only exception.</i>

249
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,013
<i>And I immediately figured out why.</i>

250
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,223
<i>He's a complete idiot.</i>

251
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,933
<i>You can't read an empty mind.</i>

252
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,935
<i>In that sense, Nendo is a scary guy.</i>

253
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,062
-He collapsed!
-Is he anemic?

254
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,772
What happened?

255
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,399
Snap out of it! You're not dead, right?

256
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,567
<i>I mean, he's not a bad guy...</i>

257
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,693
What the heck, Nendo?

258
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,528
<i>I don't think he is.</i>

259
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,071
<i>Okay, I was wrong. He's horrible.</i>

260
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:38,489
What are you doing, Nendo?

261
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,949
Get him to the nurse already!

262
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,076
Oh, right! The nurse!

263
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,037
Hey, Saiki! Go with him!

264
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,955
I'm worried about him going alone.

265
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,873
NURSE'S OFFICE

266
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,917
Hey, no one's here.

267
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,127
I guess it's time
for mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

268
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,045
<i>Cut it out, Nendo.</i>

269
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,548
What do you mean mouth-to-mouth?

270
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,799
Are you stupid?

271
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,718
Wait, so you're okay after all?

272
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,054
I was just pretending, idiot!
What's wrong with you?

273
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,348
Why did you have to kiss me?

274
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,516
Well, it was my first kiss, you know.

275
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,476
Let's just call it even.

276
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,978
<i>Way to make it worse.</i>

277
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,315
Everyone's going to think
we're in love or something!

278
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,442
<i>I guarantee no one's going to think that.</i>

279
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,362
Hey Saiki, you'd better not tell anyone
I was faking!

280
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,364
<i>This doesn't count
as my first kiss, right?</i>

281
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,490
<i>Man, this sucks!</i>

282
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,866
Keep this to yourself!

283
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,034
<i>Keep what to myself, exactly?</i>

284
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:23,993
<i>That you were faking?</i>

285
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,995
<i>Or that your first kiss</i>

286
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,372
<i>was with Nendo?</i>

287
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,374
<i>If it's the faking, the jig is already up.</i>

288
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,167
-I heard that.
<i>-Crap! It's Matsuzaki!</i>

289
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,585
So you were faking?

290
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,004
<i>This is bad! It's the gym teacher!</i>

291
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,255
You've got it all wrong!

292
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:37,298
It was his idea!

293
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,218
He told me to fake an illness,
so he could play hooky!

294
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,261
I'm such a bonehead for listening to him!

295
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,471
-Is that true, Nendo?
-What?

296
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,599
<i>Blaming it on Nendo? Not a bad strategy.</i>

297
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,601
Saiki, what are you doing here?

298
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:49,519
<i>What?</i>

299
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,145
Was he in on this too, Takahashi?

300
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,480
What? Oh, sure. Him, too.

301
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,315
That's it! Both of you, to my office! Now!

302
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,734
<i>Dragging me into this is a very bad idea.</i>

303
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,736
-Hold on a second.
-<i>What?</i>

304
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,238
He really is sick.

305
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,031
Didn't you hear what he said?

306
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,616
He's got bonehead.

307
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,118
<i>You've got to be kidding me.</i>

308
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,412
<i>He actually thinks "bonehead"
is an illness?</i>

309
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,538
That's it, right?

310
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,790
Bonehead? What are you talking about?

311
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,708
<i>"Bonehead"</i>

312
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,127
<i>is caused by a virus
that invades through the follicles.</i>

313
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,253
Oh, bonehead! I remember now.

314
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,838
-No way!
<i>-Wow. Dumb and dumber.</i>

315
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,589
Let's take your temperature.

316
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,550
If you're sick, you should have a fever.

317
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,511
<i>Give me a break. I don't have a fever.</i>

318
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,055
-It's 92.8 degrees.
-What?

319
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,890
Call the ambulance!

320
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,225
Hang in there!

321
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,060
Stay with us!

322
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,771
<i>I used pyrokinesis,
the ability to manipulate heat.</i>

323
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,565
<i>Looks like it melted a bit.</i>

324
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,483
<i>I need to destroy the evidence.</i>

325
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,527
-Hey...
<i>-Crap, he saw me!</i>

326
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,405
Don't tell me you caught bonehead, too!

327
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,531
Hang in there!

328
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,825
<i>Nendo is one scary fellow.</i>

329
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,708
<i>My name's Shun Kaido.</i>

330
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,210
<i>I'm an 11th grader at PK Academy.</i>

331
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,128
<i>Well, on the surface.</i>

332
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,882
<i>A dark force called Black Beat
dwells in my right arm.</i>

333
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:04,385
<i>And they want to steal it from me
and forge a new world order.</i>

334
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,305
<i>They're part of a secret society
called the Dark Reunion!</i>

335
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,223
<i>But I shall protect the world.</i>

336
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,059
<i>I, the Jet-Black Wings,
shall save the day!</i>

337
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,270
<i>That guy's brain is stuck in junior high.</i>

338
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,314
<i>Hey, did you hear the news?</i>

339
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,607
<i>A poisonous snake is on the loose!</i>

340
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,359
Seriously? That's so dangerous!

341
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,444
Are you sure it's loose?

342
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,447
Sounds like another Dark Reunion's lie.

343
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,117
But they can't fool the Jet-Black Wings!

344
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,411
Someone must have released that snake!

345
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,330
Wait a minute! You know who did this?

346
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,290
Did this Jet-Black Wings dude do it?

347
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,501
No! I'm the Jet-Black Wings!

348
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,295
A secret society called
the Dark Reunion is behind it!

349
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,423
And this is the first step
in their Human Sorting Plan!

350
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,633
<i>The Dark Reunion?</i>

351
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:44,550
<i>Never heard of them.</i>

352
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,469
What a waste of time.

353
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,972
I guess it's up to us superheroes.

354
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,224
-Right, Saiki?
<i>-Whatever.</i>

355
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,185
<i>Of course, he doesn't know
I'm actually a psychic.</i>

356
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,770
<i>It's all just part of his fantasy.</i>

357
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,979
Saiki, tell me what you think.

358
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,481
I don't like this one bit.

359
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,817
<i>That snake, which I've named
the Murder Dragoram Snake,</i>

360
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,193
<i>is probably no ordinary snake!</i>

361
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,112
<i>That's quite the dramatic name.</i>

362
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,822
<i>This Murder Dragoram Snake</i>

363
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,658
<i>is probably a dangerous monster
created in a top secret Dark Reunion lab.</i>

364
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,742
<i>That's all speculation.</i>

365
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,369
It's up to us.

366
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:15,081
-We must save humanity from...
-Hey, they caught the snake!

367
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,749
Thank goodness! Where was it?

368
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,084
In front of the gate.

369
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,336
<i>Apparently it was nearly dead.</i>

370
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,881
<i>No way! Could there be others
with powers like our own out there?</i>

371
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,133
Why was it almost dead?

372
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,301
<i>They say some elementary school kids
were messing with it.</i>

373
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,595
<i>Who knew the Murder Dragoram Snake
was so weak?</i>

374
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,514
Guess the Dark Reunion
isn't a threat after all.

375
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,392
Careful, now! This is a secret society
we're talking about!

376
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,978
Watch yourself or you will be sorted.

377
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:41,441
Go ahead, laugh while you can.

378
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,067
It's the calm before the storm.

379
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:47,029
They're coming for us.
I tried to warn you...

380
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,614
<i>He's going to the bathroom to cry.</i>

381
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,159
<i>Guess I'll go too.</i>

382
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,119
Did you see his face? It was beet red!

383
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,413
One time, he said his arm
was possessed by some demon.

384
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,957
He was like, "It's moving
inside my arm again!"

385
00:15:59,083 --> 00:15:59,917
Like this!

386
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,627
-Wait, it's actually moving!
-What?

387
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,922
Holy crap, it's a snake! Run!

388
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,132
It's blocking the door!

389
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,469
<i>I saw that whole thing coming
thanks to my powers.</i>

390
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,722
<i>But I don't want to use my powers
in front of the others,</i>

391
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,765
<i>so I'll stay here until things calm down.</i>

392
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,227
<i>Looks like he needs to calm down, too.</i>

393
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,062
<i>Let's see how they're doing...</i>

394
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,063
Where did the snake go?

395
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,482
One of you guys call the teacher!

396
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,233
No way! It'll bite us!

397
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:25,985
You little wimps!

398
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,571
-Nendo! Where did you come from?
-What's wrong? Did you lose your balls?

399
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,615
-I would worry about your own!
-Is that so?

400
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,741
Look!

401
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,367
It's biting your balls!

402
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,246
-Nendo!
-Nendo!

403
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,164
<i>I'm a goner.</i>

404
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,751
<i>Calm down. It was only biting his pants.</i>

405
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:42,793
<i>Clairvoyance.</i>

406
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,337
<i>Saiki crosses his eyes,</i>

407
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,131
<i>granting him the power to see
far-off places!</i>

408
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,091
<i>-You guys, escape!</i>
-What?

409
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,593
I'll handle this!

410
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,261
Kaido? What the heck are you doing?

411
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,180
Murder Dragoram Snake.

412
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,183
The Jet-Black Wings himself stands
before you! Prepare yourself!

413
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,351
What a weird pose!

414
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,602
Let's get out of here!

415
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,647
He actually thinks he's a superhero.

416
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,315
<i>Well, he's acting tough,</i>

417
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,526
<i>but you should hear what's going on
inside his head.</i>

418
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,779
<i>Why am I standing in front of this thing?
What's wrong with me?</i>

419
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,158
<i>Now I've gone and done it!</i>

420
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,493
<i>Sorry, Mom.</i>

421
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,871
-Take this! Judgment Knights of...
-<i>Sorry, Kaido.</i>

422
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,665
<i>I'm afraid I have to steal your thunder.</i>

423
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,750
Thunder!

424
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,671
-What?
-Wow!

425
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,422
Go the Jet-Black Wings!

426
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,341
<i>Sorry for that crack about junior high.</i>

427
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,884
<i>Truth is, you may not have powers,</i>

428
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,844
<i>but you're more courageous than most.</i>

429
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,930
<i>I really am a superhero!</i>

430
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,683
<i>And the crisis came to an end.</i>

431
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,269
I'm not liking this new attitude
of yours, Kaido.

432
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,770
Watch your tone.

433
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:46,148
Unless you wish to be hunted
by the Judgment Knights of Thunder.

434
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,400
Counselor's room. Now.

435
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,026
<i>Now, he's even more delusional
than before.</i>

436
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,736
<i>That guy is hopeless.</i>

437
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,827
<i>Beautiful girls.</i>

438
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,371
<i>There's nothing like a pretty girl
who stands out from the flock.</i>

439
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,915
<i>My name is Kokomi Teruhashi.</i>

440
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,210
<i>Not to brag or anything, but I'm
the perfect example of a pretty girl.</i>

441
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:09,589
<i>I'm not trying to be arrogant.
I'm just stating a fact.</i>

442
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,301
<i>It's not like I go around
boasting about how pretty I am.</i>

443
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,428
Hey, how about we go get some tea?

444
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,179
<i>Now if I were a normal girl...</i>

445
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,515
How about you visit a pigsty
and ask one of the pigs out?

446
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,309
<i>I would probably say something like that.</i>

447
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:22,810
<i>But I'm different.</i>

448
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,604
I'm so sorry.

449
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,814
I really have to go study.

450
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,233
Good luck!

451
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,862
<i>See? I'm beautiful on the outside
and the inside!</i>

452
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,614
<i>And do you know what that means?</i>

453
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,449
<i>It means I'm incomparable!</i>

454
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,577
<i>That guy is from my class.</i>

455
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,661
<i>What was his name?</i>

456
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,038
<i>Oh, right. Saiki.</i>

457
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,372
<i>Kunio Saiki.</i>

458
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,625
<i>He looks so lonely walking like that.</i>

459
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,461
<i>Maybe I should call out to him
and brighten his day.</i>

460
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,756
<i>After all, I'm perfect on the outside</i>

461
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,966
<i>and the inside!</i>

462
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:55,468
Hi, Saiki!

463
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,428
So, it is you!

464
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,638
<i>There you go!</i>

465
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,806
<i>Now you have a memory to cherish forever!</i>

466
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,060
<i>You randomly ran into the prettiest girl
in class.</i>

467
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,687
<i>Not to mention she came
running over to greet you!</i>

468
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,773
<i>I bet you're head over heels in love
with me!</i>

469
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,442
<i>That's fine! I may be way
out of your league, but be my guest!</i>

470
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,152
<i>Who would blame you?</i>

471
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,863
<i>No one can resist my beauty!</i>

472
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:18,824
<i>That's it?</i>

473
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,077
-<i>What kind of reaction was that?</i>
-Oh, Teruhashi!

474
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,080
<i>I know! He was so surprised
that he was lost for words!</i>

475
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,499
<i>That's the only logical explanation!</i>

476
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:27,583
<i>Poor thing.</i>

477
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,378
<i>I bet he's kicking himself right now
for missing his opportunity.</i>

478
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,880
<i>It's okay. I'll give him another chance.</i>

479
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,634
<i>And that's because I'm perfect
inside and out!</i>

480
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,221
Saiki! Hey, you shouldn't
ignore people, you know!

481
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,555
<i>He didn't even nod!</i>

482
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,433
<i>Did he not see me? Am I dead?</i>

483
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,268
<i>Oh, I've got it this time!</i>

484
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,771
<i>He must think I'm an illusion!</i>

485
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,231
<i>He's led such an unfortunate life</i>

486
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,149
<i>that he can't bring himself
to think I'm real!</i>

487
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,735
<i>Well, you're in for a treat!
I'm about to bestow upon you</i>

488
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,404
<i>the happiest moment of your life!</i>

489
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:00,533
Saiki, where are you off to?

490
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:02,535
<i>He dodged me!</i>

491
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,536
<i>What's going on?</i>

492
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,871
<i>Most people don't try to dodge illusions.</i>

493
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,709
<i>Wait, is he afraid of even touching
such an ethereal being?</i>

494
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:14,797
<i>I can't believe I mean
so much to this guy!</i>

495
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,217
<i>Great. Another annoying person
to deal with.</i>

496
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,428
Hey, Saiki!

497
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,429
<i>Back again?</i>

498
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,598
<i>I guess she's not familiar
with the concept of rejection.</i>

499
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:27,226
<i>Well, it's true that ordinary people...</i>

500
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,437
Wow! Hi, Teruhashi.

501
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,813
<i>They'd probably react like that.</i>

502
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,731
<i>Even Nendo...</i>

503
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,441
Oh, Teruhashi.

504
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:34,567
<i>He wouldn't be immune.</i>

505
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,445
<i>Everything she says about herself
is actually quite true.</i>

506
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,196
<i>And that's why she's so dangerous.</i>

507
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,157
<i>Teruhashi is an attention magnet.</i>

508
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,491
<i>She's the last person</i>

509
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,368
-<i>I'd like to be around.</i>
-Hey, where are you headed?

510
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,163
Do you mind if I tag along?

511
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,789
<i>What? Nendo?</i>

512
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,416
<i>This isn't good.</i>

513
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,168
<i>If he points her out to me,</i>

514
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,628
<i>I'll have no choice
but to acknowledge her existence.</i>

515
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,922
<i>And then I'll have to pretend
to worship her.</i>

516
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,507
Oh, wow! Teruhashi!

517
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,134
<i>I really don't want to do that.</i>

518
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,094
<i>I'll blend in with the crowd.</i>

519
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,638
<i>Is he gone? That was close...</i>

520
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,475
What? I have a feeling
that my pal was here.

521
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,227
What? Where did Saiki go?

522
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,479
What happened?

523
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,523
-<i>Great. I accidentally teleported.</i>
-Saiki!

524
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,693
<i>It doesn't look like the people
around me noticed,</i>

525
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,196
<i>but Teruhashi seems to think
something's not right.</i>

526
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,990
<i>Just think of me as an illusion
and forget about the whole thing.</i>

527
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,325
Oh, Nendo!

528
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,412
Hey, Teruhashi.

529
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,663
Have you seen Saiki?

530
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,333
What? My pal? No, I haven't seen him.

531
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,418
<i>Wait, so he disappeared?</i>

532
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,046
<i>Was I the one
seeing the illusion all along?</i>

533
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,090
<i>You're so in love with me
that you see me everywhere you go, right?</i>

534
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,634
<i>No way...</i>

535
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,761
<i>Am I... No, that can't be true!</i>

536
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,263
<i>Oh, no! What's this feeling inside of me?</i>

537
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,143
<i>Am I actually in love with Saiki?</i>

538
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,145
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

539
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,356
<i>Teruhashi...</i>

540
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,865
<i>My name is Kusuo Saiki.</i>

541
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:31,201
<i>This is pretty important information,
so let me refresh your memory.</i>

542
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,329
<i>I'm a psychic with vast psychic powers.</i>

543
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,873
<i>I wish they would shut up already.</i>

544
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,500
<i>Next time...</i>

545
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,544
<i>I'll keep knocking out episodes
taken from the manga.</i>
