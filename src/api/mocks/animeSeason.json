After years of painstaking research, the Republic finally developed autonomous drones of their own, turning the one-sided struggle into a war without casualties—or at least, that's what the government claims.\n\nIn truth, there is no such thing as a bloodless war. Beyond the fortified walls protecting the eighty-five Republic territories lies the \"nonexistent\" Eighty-Sixth Sector. The young men and women of this forsaken land are branded the Eighty-Six and, stripped of their humanity, pilot the \"unmanned\" weapons into battle...\n\nShinn directs the actions of a detachment of young Eighty-Sixers while on the battlefield. Lena is a \"handler\" who commands the detachment from the remote rear with the help of special communication.\n\nThe farewell story of the severe and sad struggle of these two begins!\n\n(Source: MU, Yen Press; edited)",
